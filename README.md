# Lab1A-UsingGit
Lab 1A: 
This is the first week of labs (week of 9/7/2020). We will learn how to use git to version control our work and github to manage remote projects. 

## How Labs will Run
- Walk in & Discussion of concepts in Readings
- Start Excuting Parts of Lab

If you have questions
- reread/ retry the point where you have an issue, documenting your problem
- send a message to the troubleshooting slack channel
- if Katarina is free, she will help right away, but if not, other students may help

Do not get up and go ask for help, due to social distancing concerns. 
## 0. Pre Lab
To be looked over before lab. The actions should be completed.  

### Pre Lab Actions / Requirements
Bring  your laptopto the lab session.

It will be useful to have a text editor on your computer. [Atom](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) are great choices, but you can use what you will. Notepad will suffice, but will become cumbersome quickly and is not recommended.
We will use text editors when creating README.md files. 

If you cannot make the in-person lab session for any reason, reply to the slack thread under the l

### Pre Lab Readings
Lab will make more sense and run more smoothly if you have the chance to read these beforehand. Since this lab was released late, you may not be able to. We will briefly discuss the contents in lab. Please consult these resources if you are confused about why we are doing this lab. 

The last reading, [Git vs. Github: What's the Difference?](https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/), may give you sufficient information. If not, check out the other readings. Also, as always, feel free to search the internet for more information. 

### Version Control 

#### What is it?
[What is Version Control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

#### Why use it?
[Why use a Version Control System](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/desktop-gui/basics/why-use-version-control#:~:text=%20Why%20Use%20a%20Version%20Control%20System%3F%20,a%20file%20%28or%20even%20the%20whole...%20More%20)

### What is Git? 
Git is the version control system we will use. Learn more about [git](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) specifics here. It is a-ok if not everything is clear. 

### Git Vs. Github
[Git vs. Github: What's the Difference?](https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/)

## 1. Git on your Machine 
For the labs, you will want to have git on your local machines / your laptops. 

### Is Git already installed?
Navigate to your command prompt / shell / terminal. If none of the above are features that come with your operating system, try googling first, then asking.  (If you have a windows or a mac, you should have command prompt/terminal). If you are curious, you can read an unofficial writeup about the difference between the different terms on  [askubuntu.com](https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line)
- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/)
- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)
- [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu)

Once open, type
```
git --version
```
and hit enter.

If you have git on your machine, you will see a version number. If you do have git, skip installation. 

If you want to upgrade git, please do. Search online to figure out how to upgrade git on your operating system.

### Installation
If you do not Follow the directions for your machine to [install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) git.

## 2. Your First Git Repo
First, you will make your own github repository. 
This is how you would start any solo project that you would want to put under version control. 
This is also how you would start a team project, but in that case, only one person needs to make the initial folder. 

It is a very good idea to put any coding projects under version control. 

### Make a Folder (Repository)
