# Lab1A-UsingGit
Lab 1A: 
This is the first week of labs (week of 9/7/2020). We will learn how to use git to version control our work and github to manage remote projects. 

## How Labs will Run
- Walk in & Discussion of concepts in Readings
- Start Excuting Parts of Lab

If you have questions
- reread/ retry the point where you have an issue, documenting your problem
- send a message to the troubleshooting slack channel
- if Katarina is free, she will help right away, but if not, other students may help

Do not get up and go ask for help, due to social distancing concerns. 

## Pre Lab Readings
Lab will make more sense and run more smoothly if you have the chance to read these beforehand. Since this lab was released late, you may not be able to. We will briefly discuss the contents in lab. Please use these resources when confused about why we are doing this lab. 

### Version Control: Why Use It

### What is Git 

### Git Vs. Github

## Git on your Machine 
For the labs, you will want to have git on your local machines / your laptops. 

### Is Git already installed?
Navigate to your command prompt / shell / terminal. If none of the above are features that come with your operating system, try googling first, then asking.  (If you have a windows or a mac, you should have command prompt/terminal). If you are curious, you can read an unofficial writeup about the difference between the different terms on  [askubuntu.com](https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line)
- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/)
- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)
- [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu)

Once open, type
```
git --version
```
and hit enter.

If you have git on your machine, you will see a version number. If you do have git, skip installation. 

If you want to upgrade git, please do. Search online to figure out how to upgrade git on your operating system.
